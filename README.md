 World Energy Consumption Prediction using Machine Learning

 Domain: Energy (Prediction)
 Internship: AICTE - Edunet Foundation

 Overview
 Energy consumption is a key indicator of global development and economic growth.  
 This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict future **world energy consumption** using economic and population indicators.

  Objectives
 - Analyze historical world energy data.
 - Identify key factors affecting consumption (GDP, CO₂, population).
 - Build a Machine Learning model to predict energy consumption.
 - Visualize country-wise trends and predictions.
